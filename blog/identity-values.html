                <h3>Work ethic, Kindness and Compassion, Logic, Patience, Loyalty:</h3>
                
                <p>These have been instilled into me through many personal life experiences and parents who lived by a very similar code of ethics.<br>
                    In my previous employment as an installer of residential telecommunications (a cable guy but not so "Jim Carey" ish..) I had ethical decisions to make on a regular basis.<br>
                    In a job where we were always under time pressure to put the equipment in and move on I always made a point of spending extra time (which often i didnt have) to make sure <br>
                    customers knew what they needed to know and to answer all the questions. This was especially the case with the elderly. This often meant I didnt earn as much as other techs<br>
                    but I felt it was more important to help where I could.</p><br>
                
                <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses:</h3>
                        <p>My strengths are as stated above. A work ethic (most likely from woking as a cement labourer for my father back in the days) kindness and a willingness to help where I can.
                        I have a lot of limitations but a big one for me is fearing failure. It has definitely stopped me from having a go at new things and putting myself out there.</p>
                        
                        <p>My work ethic is my biggest asset in this regard. I can be counted on to be there to do the hard yards.
                        By taking this course and giving up my latest job, I've taken one step in the right direction in regards to my fear of failure. I'm sure however there will be many more times i'll have to fight that.

                        
                        My willingness to be dependable will be a bonus for my learning colleagues but will definitely come into some conflict once I have to start choosing study over family things.</p><br>

                <h3>An example of working with others with resistance.</h3>
                       <p>My kids are a very good example of this. More often than not you're choosing between doing what they want and doing what needs to be done. 
                        Patience, Patience, Patience was always a must. Now I try to see things from their point of view as well as making sure they can make some of their own decisions instead getting them to do it my way, even if their way isn't the most efficient. It gives them a real opportunity for growth.
