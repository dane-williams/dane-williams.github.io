                        <h2>Whats the difference?</h2>
                        <h3>Relative:</h3>
                        <p>The term Relative in this case means "relative to itself". On its own you wont see much of a difference. Its not until
                           you combine it with some of the other attributes do we see how useful it can be.
                           Add top, left, bottom or right into the element along with the px measurement and you can manoeuvre
                           the around the page. You can also use z-index on the element which means it will appear
                           on top of any other statically positioned element. 
                           </p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <h3>Absolute:</h3>
                        <p>This type of positioning lets you place the element basically where ever you want 
                           it also using the top, left, bottom or right add-ons. Relative to the next parent element 
                           with relative or (absolute) positioning that is.
                           The big downside is that it can limit the flexibility of your website as its not affected by
                        and doesnt affect other elements.

                        <h3>Fixed</h3>
                        <p>Fixed is possibly the easiest to understand. Where you put it is where it will stay.
                        Regardless of how far you scroll the element remains in the same spot on the screen.
                        Very handy for use on a navigation bar that you want visible no matter what.
