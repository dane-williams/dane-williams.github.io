                        <li>Identifying emotions</li>
                        <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
                        <li>Controlling one's emotions</li>
                        <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
                        <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
                        <li>Relating to others</li><br>
                        <p>Although deemed to be a fringe concept in the 90's. People now realise the important role it plays in future health and success.<br>
                        People with good EQ tend to make better leaders and better team members as they are more aware of their own needs<br> and the needs of
                        others. It differs from traditional IQ greatly. It's sort of "Book Smarts" versus "Street Smarts". IQ is still important<br> with its emphasis
                            on quantative reasoning, Long and Short term memory and its general knowledge of the world, however EQ
                        is how you interact with the people around you which is paramount in a social species like ours.</p>
