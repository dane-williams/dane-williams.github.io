                    <p>In this blog I will be writing about problem solving. With every agonizingly frustrating day that passes its become exceedingly apparent <br>
                    that this is probably the most important attribute youll need to enhance to make it in this industry. Every facet of this initial fondations <br>
                    course has some form of problem solving involved. From the basic page layouts to styling to the much more involved interactivity that is <br>
                    utilised through Javscript you're making decisions that have problems needing to be resolved.
                    Rubber ducky  was the first method I learnt through <br>
                    the course which is simplifying the problem and trying to relay it in a way that a complete learner could understand. <br>
                    This method has helped me out tremendously especially during the freecode camp portions and also later in the Kata sections.<br>
                    During kata however I feel the method that I used the most as it was usually the first thing to try if i wasnt initially sure about what to do was to 'Try Something'. <br>Seems simple but because we had the benifit of the pre-written asserts it meant that we'd get feedback from the error codes on what was expected.   </p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Pseudocode:</li>
                         <li>Try Something:</li>
                         <li>Rubber Ducky:</li>
                         <li>Reading Error Messages:</li>
                         <li>Console.logging:</li>
                         <li>Googling:</li>
                         <li>Asking Peers:</li>
                         <li>Asking Coaches:</li>
                         <li>Reflection:</li>

                     </ul>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     <p>These are the main methods used so far. Console logging and Reading the Error Messages are two that im still getting my head around. <br>Trying to work out exactly what im looking at but the rest im feeling pretty confident with. Asking Peers and Coaches was hard at first due to not wanting<br> to feel dumb but its a natural part of the learning process so I knew it was necessary overcome that fear. <br>I was sceptical at the start of the course just how much help Reflection was going to be. My mind has changed on this. <br>The value of being able to think back on what you were trying to achieve and then what you did to get there and then further more seeing what <br>others did helps to imprint on what the best option would be in the future.
