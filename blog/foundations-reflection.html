                    <h2>Three things ive learnt about myself:</h2> 
                            
                    
                    
                     <p>I can shut down when i'm overwhelmed. I dont feel like talking and can be quite grumpy which is something i'll obviously need to work on.</p>
                        
                     <p>Theres a huge difference in clarity between my 'fresh mind' and my 'tired mind'. There were several moments where i'd struggle with something for a very long time but after a small break the answer would come to me.</p>
                         
                     <p>I definitely learn better by doing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>The role of VALUES, EMPATHY and SELF AWARENESS in learning and programming:</h2>
                     <p>In a nutshell it's about being good to yourself and to others. As stated above. Ive come to realise I work  vastly better when i'm fresh and focused. Knowing this means i'll know that taking a quick break will save time compared to pushing through in a fog. <br>
                     You need to be aware of your failings so you can mitigate and improve them whilst also leaning into your strengths. <br>Generally in life and so in programming you will work collaboratively with others. Being aware of yourself and the needs of your collaborators will make things run more smoothly. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>What suprised you the most about the core learning:</h2>
                    <p>Working in physical jobs for most of my life there was a tendency to just push through. Its been a struggle to put that mentality aside. This core has shown me that its a lot harder to do when doing things that utilise your mental faculties more.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Why Dev concentrates on this:</h2>

                    <p>Being more aware of yourself and others makes you a better learner, a better person and a better employee. So its a very important skill to learn.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Was it worth it:</h2>
                    <p>Programming skills will come with time and practice. The core skills learnt in foundations however will increase the speed at which I will learn carrying on into the future and will make me more employable and a better team member. The most useful skill its taught me is a much better awareness of my potential failings so that I can improve these.</p>
