                                <h2>Long term goal and/or career pathway:</h2>
                        <p>Id love to do something in the Development side of Maori and Pacifica health. Work for a company that promotes health and well being.<br> 
                            The film industry is a passion as well so id like to keep that in mind.</p> 
                            
                            
                                <h2>Strengths and Limitations:</h2>
                            <p>As stated in the values section im not afraid of hard work and im always willing to assist others if I am able to do so.
                                A limitation is possibly the speed at which I can work. Im not like others that seem to be able to things out on the spot, possibly a follow on form my fear off failure. Im much better a sitting down and working things out before giving my answer.</p>
                            
                                <h2>Human skills i would like help with:</h2>
                            <p>Communication and the fear of failure (being able to put myself out there).</p>
                            
                            
                                <h2> How I will manage the workload:</h2>
                                This is basically the first time I haven't been working full time for over 20 years so ill be fine working for the extended periods. I will limit distractions around the house and put devices on silent for the allotted times. I will make sure I have regular breaks to keep my mind fresh.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Letting off Steam:</h2>
                            <p>Step away for a bit. Taking the dog for a quick walk and using the boxing bag I find is a good way to let off steam.
                            </p>

                                <h2>What to do when i need help:</h2>
                            <p>Of course I will have the slack community to call on plus the facilitators. Im amassing a list of very good sources online that have good information as well.
                            </p>
                            
                                <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team:</h2>
                            <p>Give honest feedback and let me know where they think I might need to improve.</p>
                            
                            
                                <h2>Scheduling Info:</h2>
                            <p>I have friends and family that are going to help with drop offs and pickups of my two daughters for school but there will be times where this falls through and I will have to. This will mean I might be a little late for the 8.45am start time or I may have to duck out for 30minutes in the afternoon. Hopefully this will be a rarity but I will likely happen a some point.
                            </p>
