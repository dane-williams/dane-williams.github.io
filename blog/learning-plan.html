                <h1>Bootcamp Learning Additions</h1>    
                <div class="learning">
                    <h2>Long term goal and/or career pathway:</h2>
                        <p>My long term still hasnt changed. I still want to do something that helps promote well being, particularly in with Maori and Pacifica health. This course i believe is a good starting point into programming in general so it will help move towards that goal. App design and game design looking towards health and learning improvement is appealing as well.</p>

                    <h2>Strengths and Limitations:</h2>
                        <p>I dont think my self assessment has changed all that much from the previous one. Its possibly been narrowed. This will make it easier to improve. Ive started, on top of the focus meditations, using an app that is meant to help improve my "mental speed" which im now doing everyday. </p>

                    <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be:</h2>
                        <p>The share speed at which we a re likely to move will be my biggest challenge. As stated previously this is something i struggle with and something i'm working on improving.</p>

                        <h2>Human skills i would like help with:</h2>
                        <p>Same as before still. I need improvement on my communication skills. Improving self awareness is also something that will need contiual improvement.</p>

                        <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team:</h2>
                        <p>This hasnt changed either. Give honest feedback and let me know where they think I might need to improve.</p>   
                        
                        <h2>What are my expectations of myself during BootCamp:</h2>
                        <p>My expectations of myself are to bust my a** during this period and learn as much as i can. To utilise the knowledge of the Dev team as well as the other students. Ive come to realise that I do waste far to much time trying to struggle through a problem when I should be seeking help sooner so this is something i'll make a commitment to improve on. Ill plan out my time better as well to make sure i'm available for collaborations outside the normal hours.</p>

                <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
                                
                <div class="learning">
                    <h2>Long term goal and/or career pathway:</h2>
                        <p>Id love to do something in the Development side of Maori and Pacifica health. Work for a company that promotes health and well being.<br> 
                        The film industry is a passion as well so id like to keep that in mind.</p> 
                                         
                                            
                    <h2>Strengths and Limitations:</h2>
                        <p>As stated in the values section im not afraid of hard work and im always willing to assist others if I am able to do so.</p>
                         <p>A limitation is possibly the speed at which I can work. Im not like others that seem to be able to work things out on the spot, possibly a follow on from my fear of failure. Im much better at sitting down and working things out before giving my answer.</p>
                         
                    
                                            
                    <h2>Human skills i would like help with:</h2>
                        <p>Communication and the fear of failure (being able to put myself out there).</p><br>
                        <p>This hasnt changed over the foundations. See above.</p>
                                      
                                            
                    <h2> How I will manage the workload:</h2>
                        <p>This is basically the first time I haven't been working full time for over 20 years so ill be fine working for the extended periods. I will limit distractions around the house and put devices on silent for the allotted times. I will make sure I have regular breaks to keep my mind fresh.</p>

                    <h2>Letting off Steam:</h2>
                        <p>Step away for a bit. Taking the dog for a quick walk and using the boxing bag I find is a good way to let off steam.
                        </p>

                    <h2>What to do when I need help:</h2>
                        <p>Of course I will have the slack community to call on plus the facilitators. Im amassing a list of very good sources online that have good information as well.
                        </p>
                                            
                    <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team:</h2>
                        <p>Give honest feedback and let me know where they think I might need to improve.</p>
                                            
                                            
                    <h2>Scheduling Info:</h2>
                    <p>I have friends and family that are going to help with drop offs and pickups of my two daughters for school but there will be times where this falls through and I will have to do it myself. This will mean I might be a little late for the 8.45am start time or I may have to duck out for 30minutes in the afternoon. Hopefully this will be a rarity but it will likely happen a some point.
