                            <h2>Neuroplasticity:</h2> 
                            
                    <p>Neuroplasticity refers to your brains ability to change and adapt through experience. Although your brains ability to grow and take on more information is much more adept at doing so when it is young and growing, <br>
                        an older brain can as well. The best part about this is that studies show that the more you do this the easier it will become to continue this trend. <br>
                        The easiest way to utilise this is to do. When you learn a new skill new neurons are formed. The more you do this the more ingrained it will become. Neurons that represent things rarely used will <br>
                        eventually die meaning you will have to re-learn that skill. This is we are so good at adapting to a changing environment.</p>

                            <h2>Growth Mindset:</h2>
                        <p>In a nutshell its as simple as "Always look on the bright side of life". Steer away from the negative. See failures and challenges as an opportunity to improve whilst
                            ignoring that little voice in your head that is constantly telling you that you cant. <br>
                            Embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, see effort as the path to success, learn from criticism, finad lessons and inspiration in the success of others. With this you will achieve greater heights.</p>
