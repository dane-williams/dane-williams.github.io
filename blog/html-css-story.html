			          <h2>The Early Days.</h2>
			
				          <p>The Idea for Html was first thought up on a cold winters day by Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist, who at the time was doing contract work CERN (The European Orginization for Nuclear research). Berners-Lee prototyed Enquire, which was a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. 9 years later in 1989 Tim wrote a memo which proposed an internet-based hypertext system and hence HTML was born.

			            <p>5 years later CSS was born. The brain child of HÃ¥kon Wium Lie. Although there were several other style sheet languages proposed at the time CSS won the day and soon became the norm. </p>
                  <br>
			          <h2>A Match Made in Heaven.</h2>
                  
			            <p>Html really knew the nuts and bolts of putting pen to digital paper and had long been used as the staple to get information up onto the web. He was however exceedingly boring and it was soon noted that users struggled to stay awake.</p>
			            <p>CSS on the other hand brought brightness, colour and harmony to the web but didnt have the methodical nature to build pages from the ground up.</p>
			            <p>A decision was made to combine forces. Html would get the ball rolling by making a structual frame which would then be passed over to css to make it more appealing to the eye. Sort of like building a Car. Html is the engineer thats creates a usable mode of transport whilst CSS is like the designer that adds the style and flair whilst also making it more user friendly.</p>
                  <br>
			          <h2>Whats Next.</h2>
                  
			            <p>Html and CSS have been working solidly together now for almost 30 years. Although technology has increased significantly in that time the core of what these two dynamoes do remains the same. Combine their unique attributes to make beautiful music together.</p>
