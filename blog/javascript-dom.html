                                                <h2>HTML and CSS: Whats the deal?</h2> 
                                               
                                        <p>In plain and simple terms. Html is your structure. Its the basic framework that makes up your page. While CSS brings the pretty. Lets look at it this way. If you are making a scary movie in a "Haunted House". HTML is the house itself. All boring and nothing special or scary about it. CSS is the set designer and set dresser that come in and and the cobwebs and the tattered curtains and the stains to up the fear factor. <br>
                                            Then to add to this metaphor you got a third piece to the puzzle, Javascript. Javascript are the special effects that are what interact with the actors. The light dusty old light that flickers, the creaky footsteps coming from the attic. The lightning and thunder that booms from outside the window. <br>
                                            All these are brought together to create a more immersive experience. </p> 
                                            
                                            
                                                <h2>Flow and Loops:</h2>
                                            <p>Control flow is basically the particular way the programme proceeds. This is done in a predetermined manner. Unless however something arises which changes that. This is called a conditional structure or if/else statement. While driving to work "IF" there is a traffic jam ring your boss and tell him your going to be late "else" continue on your way. <br>
                                                Loops are slightly different. They use the statements, for-while and do-while. With these the programme is saying do this while this is still happening.  You can look at it this way. </p>
                                            
                                                <h2>Human skills i would like help with:</h2>
                                            <p>Communication and the fear of failure (being able to put myself out there).</p>
                                            
                                            
                                                <h2> How I will manage the workload:</h2>
                                                This is basically the first time I haven't been working full time for over 20 years so ill be fine working for the extended periods. I will limit distractions around the house and put devices on silent for the allotted times. I will make sure I have regular breaks to keep my mind fresh.
                                                </p>

                                                <h2>Letting off Steam:</h2>
                                            <p>Step away for a bit. Taking the dog for a quick walk and using the boxing bag I find is a good way to let off steam.
                                            </p>

                                                <h2>What to do when I need help:</h2>
                                            <p>Of course I will have the slack community to call on plus the facilitators. Im amassing a list of very good sources online that have good information as well.
                                            </p>
                                            
                                                <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team:</h2>
                                            <p>Give honest feedback and let me know where they think I might need to improve.</p>
                                            
                                            
                                                <h2>Scheduling Info:</h2>
                                            <p>I have friends and family that are going to help with drop offs and pickups of my two daughters for school but there will be times where this falls through and I will have to do it myself. This will mean I might be a little late for the 8.45am start time or I may have to duck out for 30minutes in the afternoon. Hopefully this will be a rarity but it will likely happen a some point.
                                            </p>
